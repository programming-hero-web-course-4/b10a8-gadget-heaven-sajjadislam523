## 🛠️ React Fundamentals Used

This project leverages core React concepts:

1. **Components** - Modular components such as `ProductCard`, `ProductDetails`, `Navbar`, and `Footer` keep the code organized and reusable.
2. **Props** - Props are used for passing data between components, making the UI more dynamic and flexible.
3. **State Management** - State is managed locally using `useState`, and side effects are handled with `useEffect`.
4. **React Router** - The app uses `react-router-dom` for seamless page navigation and a single-page application experience.
5. **Context API** - Global state management using Context API to share data (cart and favorites) across components without prop drilling.

## 💾 Data Handling and Management

-   **Context API**: Manages global states for cart and favorite items across the application, providing a consistent user experience.
-   **Local Storage**: Data is stored in the browser’s local storage to persist cart and favorite items, so they remain accessible even after refreshing the page.
